# Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java, built using Maven.

## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game progresses in generations, with cells on a grid being born, surviving, or dying based on simple rules.

## Installation

To build and run the project, ensure you have Maven installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Build the project using Maven:

mvn clean install

## Usage
The main functionality of the project is implemented in the `GameOfLifeSolution` class. 

Additionally, unit tests are provided in the `GameOfLifeTest` class to ensure the correctness of the implementation. You can run these tests using Maven:

mvn test
